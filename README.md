Writing up a gamejam should be pretty simple; it needs
* a start and end date
* prizes  
* judges

the goal is engagement with the community so structuring it to allow a wide range of skills and skill levels to participate is important. 

Starting suggestion; 
1. run it for November, 
2. call for volunteer judges, 
3. do a community choice survey at the end. 
4. Choose a theme e.g. ‘bots’ or ‘retro’. What do you think?

I was thinking of bots because they can be very simple or sophisticated - supporting a wide range of skill levels having some fun.
