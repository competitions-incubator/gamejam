racket gamejam

Writing up a gamejam should be pretty simple; it needs
* a start and end date
* resources for game dev on racket
* prizes  
* judges

the goal is engagement with the community so structuring it to allow a wide range of skills and skill levels to participate is important. 

Starting suggestion; 
1. run it for November, 
2. call for volunteer judges, 
3. do a community choice survey at the end. 
4. Choose a theme e.g. ‘bots’ or ‘retro’. What do you think?

I was thinking of bots because they can be very simple or sophisticated - supporting a wide range of skill levels having some fun.

# suggestions

> For a "bots" theme I would read that to mean your game should have bots, robots, cyborgs, Terminators, automatons, Frankenstein's monsters, etc. in someway in your game. 

> Examples:
- Escape from Killer Robots (a Roguelike where you are chased in a maze by Killer Robots)
- Robot Finds Kitten (The player, a Robot, must discover items in a room that are not Kitten.  Game ends when Kitten is found.)
- Will CX-437 Ever Find Love? (a visual novel about a steam automaton in Olde Victorian Steampunk Tymes.)
- Roboblocks (a falling block puzzle where the falling blocks are robot parts and the goal is to match parts to make robots)
- ELIZA on PTO (what happens when Weizenbaum's creation goes on vacation)
