# Gamejam

So you want to host a Racket gamejam? Follow these steps to get started!

Writing up a gamejam should be pretty simple; it needs:
* a start and end date - not too close to lisp gamejam (good tip from @samdphillips)
* a theme
* some game resources to kickstart
* judges & criteria
* prizes

The goal is to create engagement within the community, so take care to keep the bar low as to allow a wide range of skills and skill levels to participate.

Starting suggestion:
1. run it for November, 
2. call for volunteer judges, 
3. do a community choice survey at the end. 
4. Choose a theme e.g. ‘bots’ or ‘retro’. What do you think?

A game framework: 

From @soegaard

> I have for a long time had the idea to make a "game framework" for making (similar) levels, and then let users implement their own levels.
> Something very simple - like the old commodore 64 game Snoopy.
Levels were single screen. The objective was go get from the left side to the right side
avoiding a few obstacles.

# ideas 

> I was thinking of bots because they can be very simple or sophisticated - supporting a wide range of skill levels having some fun.

> For a "bots" theme I would read that to mean your game should have bots, robots, cyborgs, Terminators, automatons, Frankenstein's monsters, etc. in someway in your game. 

> Examples:
- Escape from Killer Robots (a Roguelike where you are chased in a maze by Killer Robots)
- Robot Finds Kitten (The player, a Robot, must discover items in a room that are not Kitten.  Game ends when Kitten is found.)
- Will CX-437 Ever Find Love? (a visual novel about a steam automaton in Olde Victorian Steampunk Tymes.)
- Roboblocks (a falling block puzzle where the falling blocks are robot parts and the goal is to match parts to make robots)
- ELIZA on PTO (what happens when Weizenbaum's creation goes on vacation)
