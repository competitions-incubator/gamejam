racket gamejam

Writing up a gamejam should be pretty simple; it needs a start date and an end date, prizes and judges, the goal is engagement with the community so structuring it to allow a wide range of skills and skill levels to participate is important. Starting suggestion; run it for November, call for volunteer judges, but also do a community choice survey at the end. A theme seems to be a common; maybe technical theme e.g. ‘bots’ or ‘retro’. What do you think?


I was thinking of bots because they can be very simple or sophisticated - supporting a wide range of skill levels having some fun
